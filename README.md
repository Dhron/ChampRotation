# ChampRotation
Using the League of Legends API to display the free champs of the week. 
This is in development and not usable at this point.

To implement:

Make page cycle through free champions images on background.
Upon transition, display stats for that corresponding champion.
While inactive, page transitions according to set timer; otherwise, timer halts while user is active.
